1: Quartus
2: New project wizard
3: Name + location
4: first_fpga_project
5: empty projet
6: add files later
7: FAMILY: Cyclone V
8: Cyclone V SX Extended Features
9: 5CSXFC6D6F31C6
10: EDA Tool settings none in all
11: New: Design files - Block diagram
12: Save
13: New: Verilog file -> counter.v
14: create a new symbol from file for your counter
15: use it in the bdf file
16: get PLL from the IP generator under clocks
17: in the MEGAWIZ
	*edit the reference frequency to your liking. We chose 50MHz from CLK0P on PIN-AF14
	*output clock: 2MHz
	*disable locked output
18: get the pll block
19: add 3 pins 1 o/p and 2 i/p
20: attach them to the pll and counter
21: top level is done!
22: synthesize your design
23: use the pin planner to assing your pins
	*PIN_AF14 for CLK0P
	*PIN_AA24 for led0	
	*PIN_AJ4 for KEY0
24: use the I/O standard 3.3-V LVTTL
25: design, assignment, device, device and pins options, unused pins use "tristated" to avoid dim unused leds
26: synthesize the design again. 
27: make sure that your MSEL[4:0] is "10010"
28: find your fpga then flash the .sof file on the fpga
	
You can make your FPGA file permanent on the EPCS by converting the .sof to .jic from the convert programming file
in quartus.

Configuration device: EPCS128
Flash loader: add device 5CSXFC6D6F31C6
Add sof data
then generate

when you try to load the .jic file the programmer tool will auto detect the EPCS128 unit and will give you the option
to erase what is on it and program/configure the EPCS
